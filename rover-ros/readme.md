# Rover ROS
This is where we will store all the ROS specific nodes to run on the main computer of the rover currently it is pretty empty.


### Depth Image Viewer
Test node to try and pull video data and display on a window to test the realsense.
Take a look at it to see how it works
the only notable source code is a python file called depth-image-viewer.py or sum sh



### Realsense-ros
This is a ros node made by intel that we will use to pull the video feeds from the camera.
